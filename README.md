## General info
This project is a simple weather application that uses API calls to the openweathermap (https://openweathermap.org/) site in order to provide:
* A search function that allows the user to see the weather for a city they search for
* A presentation of current weather in the city
* A presentation of predicted weather for the next 5 days

The last 5 cities that have been searched by the user are saved as clickable 'tiles' to return to later if desired. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS
* Javascript (Vanilla)
* day.js (an improved date/time parsing widget)
	
## Guidelines
* Users can search for a city using the search bar
* To return to a previously searched city, users can click on the tile of that city.
